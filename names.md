# Who Are You?

* exercise
* game
* name 
* generation

A short story on inventing names without a CS or linguistic major.


## Problem
Still working on a 4X space game with multiple races. 
There are leaders, ships, planets and stars to name.
Each race has its language. 
Their names have a certain sound and melody.
A human player should able to associate entities with
another player based on their name. 
Sounds terribly complicated. Doesn't have to be.
